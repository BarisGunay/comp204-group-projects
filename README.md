# COMP204 Group Projects

## Overview
This Python-based project combines the classic gameplay of Tetris with the number merging challenge of 2048, offering a unique puzzle experience. Using libraries such as `stddraw`, `color`, and `picture`, the game features a graphical interface where players manipulate tetrominoes made of tiles, aiming to merge numbers and clear lines.
